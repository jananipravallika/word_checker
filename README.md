# word_checker

The word checker algorithm compares every word you type
to its own list of words in the language you are using.
Every time you type a string of letters and end it with one of 
these things, the word checker compares that string to a list 
of words that has been programmed into it. If your string of 
letters is not in the utilityâ€™s internal list, it flags it.
